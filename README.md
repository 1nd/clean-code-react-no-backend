# clean-code-react-no-backend
An example of directory structure and code snippets for using Clean Code Architecture on a React.js app that does not contain backend. 

This repository is my note from learning how to apply Clean Code Architecture for a React.js app. In this case, the React.js app:
- Uses Typescript.
- Uses GraphQL and Apollo as the GraphQL library.
- Has server-side rendering.
- Does not contain backend since its backend is provided by other app(s). The React.js app access the backend by calling its API via GraphQL.

Since this is a learning note, it will contain mistakes and I do not intend it to be a knowledge source you can cite for your learning. I do not monitor the repository so Issues, Pull Requests, or any kind of comments may end up unanswered.
